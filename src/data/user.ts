			title: "ODITI E-commerce store",
			description: `
ODITI is an E-commerce store built with Shopify to sell premium prints in collaboration with high-profile artists. ODITI was a pivot from the studio.oditi.com platform and a new market for the whole team.
<br>
<br>
I designed and built the entirety of the storefront using my own custom Shopify theme. I also setup a custom shop API which could be used to interact with different print-providers around the world,
automating the entier process from customer order, to shipping and order fulfillment. I also worked closely alongside co-founder and designer MILLINSKY (Alexandre Daillance) to ensure the site met the premium look and feel requirements.

			title: "studio.oditi.com (PROSPECT 100)",
			description: `
studio.oditi.com (formerly PROSPECT 100) was a co-collaboration design platform I built from scratch with 1 other developer.
I was responsible and sole developer of the platforms frontend, as well as working on all other aspects of the platform including the Python backend, PostgreSQL database and GCP deployments.
<br />
<br />
The platform was built using ReactJS on the frontend and Flask on the backend. I worked closely alongside the co-founders of ODITI to bring their ideas to life within <strong>very</strong> short turnaround periods,
often a matter of days for major releases - there was a lot of all-night hackathon sessions! As a founding engineer I was also responsible for resolving any issues that would arise no matter the time, be it 4am or 4pm.
<br />
<br />
I worked on the platform over a period of 2 and a half years, growing it from a simple MVP to over <strong>100,000</strong> users and <strong>millions</strong> of page views. We worked alongside massive brands wuch as Swatch,
and artists such as Masego and Duran Duran, bringing their design ideas to life through co-collaboration!
